PINT is not TEMPO3
------------------

PINT is a project to develop a new pulsar timing solution based on
python and modern libraries. It is still in active development,
but it can already produce residuals from most "normal"
timing models that agree with Tempo and Tempo2 to within ~10
nanoseconds. It can be used within python scripts or notebooks,
and there are several command line tools that come with it.

The primary reasons we are developing PINT are:

* To have a robust system to check high-precision timing results that is
  completely independent of TEMPO and Tempo2

* To make a system that is easy to extend and modify due to a good design
  and the use of a modern programming language, techniques, and libraries.

Installing
----------

Currently PINT is not available via PyPI or Conda. To install it you must
obtain the source from GitHub (for example by cloning it), then install
it, ensuring that all dependencies needed to run PINT are available::

    $ pip install .

Be aware that both PINT and AstroPy require data files from the Internet,
for example the International Earth Rotation Service bulletins, which are
regularly updated.  These files are cached, where possible, so once they
have been downloaded you should be able to use PINT and AstroPy offline
unless you require new data (for example you request a time more recent
than your IERS bulletin contains).
